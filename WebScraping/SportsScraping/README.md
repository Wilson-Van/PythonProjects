# Draftkings Scraping

## Description:

This is a simple program that will show betting prompts and their odds from specific sportsbooks. The information given will be moneyline, spread, and the over/under betting prompts. 

## Purpose/Reasoning:

I am doing this project for a couple different reasons. The first reason is to apply what I have learned from my other web scraping project (QuoteScraping.py) to another website to actually see if I can do what it taught me or if I was just autopiloting and just following the tutorial (I hope that it is the former). I also have many friends and family members who enjoy watching and betting on sports so I would like to be able to create this project and show it off to them and learn a little more about sports and sports betting myself. I also would like to get some experience with APIs so this project will allow me to learn how to use APIs

## Tools:

I will be using multiple APIs such as "The Odds" which will give me information on betting prompts and other information. I will also be using the requests library for API calls.

## Resources:

I will be using "The Odds" API to get the betting information but after I am able to print the spreads and other information on actual prompts of sports betting I hope to get information on other websites such as SportsReference (https://www.sports-reference.com/) to get information on players' averages and even teams' averages.

## Output:

When this project is complete I hope to have an output which the user selects which sportsbook they will want to get information on, after selecting they will be able to see the matchups and a couple of simple prompts they might be interested in. After implementing that to improve this project I could get information to help the user make a more informed decision on how they would want to bet on the selected game of their choice.

## Issues:

I originally wanted to scrape using Draftkings but after reading the terms of services (TOS) scraping even if it is to just look at the data is prohibited so I will instead be using a different API called "The Odds". I originally though I would be web scraping on this project and thought I would be using the BeautifulSoup library to get information but so far I have not needed to as the API does it for me. I will update this README as my program progresses so some of these issues may be changed in the future as the script evolves.
