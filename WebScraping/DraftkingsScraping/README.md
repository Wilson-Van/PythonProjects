# Draftkings Scraping

## Description:

This is a simple program that will take the information from DraftKings ("https://www.draftkings.com/") and get the information on certain sports, this includes the teams playing on a specific night, the matchups, spread, and other prompts. 

## Purpose/Reasoning:

I am doing this project for a couple different reasons. The first reason is to apply what I have learned from my other web scraping project (QuoteScraping.py) to another website to actually see if I can do what it taught me or if I was just autopiloting and just following the tutorial (I hope that it is the former). I also have many friends and family members who enjoy watching and betting on sports so I would like to be able to create this project and show it off to them and learn a little more about sports and sports betting myself. 

## Tools:

I will be using multiple different libraries which I will be installing with pip. The libraries I will be using are requests, bs4 (BeautifulSoup).

## Resources:

I so far have not used any resources other than the DraftKings website (https://www.draftkings.com/) but after I am able to print the spreads and other information on actual prompts of sports betting I hope to get information on other websites such as SportsReference (https://www.sports-reference.com/) to get information on players' averages and even teams' averages.

## Output:

When this project is complete I hope to have an output which the user selects which sportsbook they will want to get information on, after selecting they will be able to see the matchups and a couple of simple prompts they might be interested in. After implementing that to improve this project I could get information to help the user make a more informed decision on how they would want to bet on the selected game of their choice.
